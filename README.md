# Credit Scoring ML Model

This repository contains the code and resources for building a credit scoring model using data provided by an eCommerce platform. The model categorizes users as high risk or low risk, selects observable features as predictors of default, assigns risk probability, assigns credit scores, and predicts the optimal amount and duration of loans.

### Directories
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **scripts**: Scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **src**: Source code for the core functionality of the credit scoring model.
- **tests**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
